# Packages used 
- Numpy (convolve function)
- Numpy (svd function)

- np.convolve was used for convolving two 1 dimensional array. The function is used becuase the computational time was very high while creating our own function 
- np.linalg.svd was used for seperating kernels into two 1 dimensional arrays in order to perform convolution in an efficient manner
